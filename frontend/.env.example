# Nisse Frontend — Environment Variables
#
# IMPORTANT: Create a .env.local file for secrets (API keys, OAuth).
# .env.local is loaded by Next.js in ALL modes (dev + build) and is gitignored.
# .env.development is ONLY loaded during "next dev", NOT during "next build" (iOS).

# Backend host for Next.js rewrite proxy (no /api/v1 suffix)
# Vercel production: set to https://receptsida-production.up.railway.app
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000

# Full API URL — used by SSR and as fallback
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/v1

# Native API URL — used by Capacitor iOS/Android builds (must NOT be localhost)
# If not set, falls back to https://receptsida-production.up.railway.app/api/v1
# NEXT_PUBLIC_NATIVE_API_URL=https://receptsida-production.up.railway.app/api/v1

# Google OAuth (same Client ID as backend)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com

# Apple Sign-In
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLE_CLIENT_ID=com.matkompass.app

# Google Maps — store finder on /butiker
# Put this in .env.local so it's available for both web dev AND iOS builds.
# In Google Cloud Console, add these to the key's allowed HTTP referrers:
#   - localhost (for dev)
#   - https://localhost (for Capacitor iOS WebView)
#   - your-domain.vercel.app (for production)
